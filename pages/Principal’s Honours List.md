**Aims**

<p style="text-align: justify;">TK’s mission is to nurture students to their fullest potential, developing in them sound values and leadership skills, in an environment that encourages creativity and dynamism.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Principal’s Honours List (PHL) students are given varied platforms for them to develop both their academic and non-academic domains.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The PHL students are expected to live out TK values of Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity and Compassion as well as embody the characteristics of the TK Graduate.</p>

The objectives of the PHL programme are as follows:

1.  To enhance cognitive development with a focus on critical inventive thinking
2.  To learn new skills through the varied platforms provided to them
3.  To possess strong leadership and communication skills
4.  To contribute back to the school and/or the community

 **Approach**

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Principal’s Honours List students are determined after the final-year examinations at the end of each academic year. Eligibility is determined based on the combined marks for all subjects taken in the academic year.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Each level of PHL will be also have macro-thematic approach to ensure spiraling growth of our PHL students.</p>

**Da Vinci Plus Programme**

<p style="text-align: justify;">The programme is for our Secondary Two and Three Principal’s Honours List students. The focus of the programme is developing TK graduates who are ready to face the key driving forces of the future – globalisation, changing demographics and technological advancements.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this programme, our students will embark on research projects which will sharpen their thinking processes. The projects are categorised into 5 domains – Cognitive Domain, Sports and Health Domain, Arts and Aesthetics Domain, Character and Leadership Domain and Community and Citizenship Domain. The projects will involve student-centred questioning or inquiry and will focus on enhancing students’ 21st Century Competencies. This will lead to greater understanding of the discipline and students will also develop the corresponding ability to formulate patterns, correlations or similarities.</p>
