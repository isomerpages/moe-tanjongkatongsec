**TD@TK Application: DSA – STEM@TK (Einstein Plus)**

 STEM@TK is a programme to inculcate the spirit of inquiry and scientific thinking in our students. We aim for our students to be able to identify and provide solutions to real-life problems through scientific inquiry, using mathematics as a tool for data analysis and interpretation.

Selected students are chosen from the Direct School Admission (DSA) process to fuel their interest and further their learning and exploration of STEM.

**EINSTEIN PLUS (DSA)**

Students who are selected to be in the STEM@TK programme via DSA, will embark on the Einstein Plus Projects together with the Principal’s Honours List students. They will be mentored and monitored by the teachers for this process.

The details are as such;
