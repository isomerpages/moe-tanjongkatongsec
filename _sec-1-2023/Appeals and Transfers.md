# Appeals and Transfers

<b><u>Appeals to be admitted to TKSS</u></b>

**Information to note:**

*   School admissions are based on merit in the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise. Posting decisions are based on objective and transparent measures of academic merit i.e. PSLE scores. Appeals that take place after the S1 Posting Exercise must be aligned to these principles, in order to be fair to other admitted students.  
      
    
*   Primary 6 students who have applied to TKSS during MOE’s Secondary 1 Posting Exercise but are unsuccessful, may appeal to be considered for transfer to TKSS. These students appealing for admission to TK after the release of the Secondary 1 Posting result have to meet the school’s cut-off point (COP).  
    (\*Note: Students admitted to a school through the DSA-Sec Exercise will not be allowed to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE results. They are expected to honour the commitment to the posted DSA school for the duration of the programme admitted to.)  
      
    

*   For more information, please refer to MOE’s website for appeals and transfers.

**Application period and procedure for appeal to TKSS:**

**What happens after I appeal to TK?**

*   All applicants will be put on the waiting list. The school’s decision will be made after the vacancies are ascertained following the release of the Secondary 1 posting results and deadline for online appeal application is over. However, based on past years’ experience, the number of places are limited.

*   Application without supporting documents, incomplete form or late submission will not be processed.

*   Students who wish to transfer to another school for reasons other than those above may approach the other school directly for a place.
