### **Academic Year 2024**

**Welcome Note from Principal to Sec 1 Parents and Students**

My staff and I warmly welcome you and your child to be part of the TK family!

The next four years of Secondary School education will mark another significant milestone for your child. This journey will be both exciting and fulfilling as TK provides a safe and nurturing environment and holistic learning experiences that aim to inculcate values, socio-emotional competencies and their intrinsic motivation to learn and grow. Our team of dedicated and caring staff will be alongside with your child to provide the necessary support and guidance to equip them with the skills and mindset to thrive in the new environment. I will be elaborating more on the school programmes, curriculum and learning support structures during the Parent Engagement cum CCA briefing Session on&nbsp;**13 January, 8.30 am**. More details will be made available at a later date via Parents Gateway.

Please do approach our staff members should you need any form of support with regard to the registration administrative matters. We look forward to working in partnership with you to develop your child to his or her fullest potential.

_Mrs Dolly Ong, Principal, TKSS_
