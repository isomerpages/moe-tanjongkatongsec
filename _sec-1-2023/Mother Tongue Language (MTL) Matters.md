**_Can my child apply to take HMTL?_**

Students are eligible to take up HMTL (Higher Chinese/ Higher Malay/ Higher Tamil) from S1 onwards if they have:

*   An overall PSLE score of 8 or better; OR
*   An overall PSLE score of 9 to 14 (inclusive); and attain AL1 / AL2 in MTL or Distinction / Merit in HMTL.

If your child is eligible and interested, they can exercise their HMTL option through their Mother Tongue teachers. They will attend HMTL (Higher Chinese / Higher Malay) at TK during curriculum time.

Students who wish to take Higher Tamil will need to attend lessons at a designated centre which offers Higher Tamil outside of curriculum time.

If your child is not eligible, but interested, your child will be required to take a test in January, for the school to assess if your child is suitable to take HMTL.

Parents are advised to purchase MT/ HMTL textbook only after receiving the confirmation letter to be offered HMTL.
