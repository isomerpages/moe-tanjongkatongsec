**Da Vinci Curriculum@TK â€“ Development of Critical and Inventive Thinking (CIT) 21st Century Competencies**

**Objectives of Curriculum**

Da Vinci Curriculum@TK aims to equip our students with disciplinarity knowledge and develop their competencies to investigate issues or problems critically and to invent solutions to address them.

**Design of Curriculum**

The design of Da Vinci Curriculum@TK is principled on 2 models:

**Sequenced Model**

Topics from different disciplines are rearranged and sequenced to coincide with one another. Similar ideas are taught in concert while remaining separate disciplines.

**Webbed Model**

A theme is weaved or webbed into relevant disciplines to pull what are separate and disparate parts of the curriculum together for learners.

The theme chosen must be a good lens that

*   applies broadly
*   applies pervasively
*   discloses fundamental patterns
*   reveals similarities and contrasts
*   fascinates learners.
    

**Outcome of Curriculum**

The culminating task for each level of this curriculum is a Values-In-Action (VIA) project. In groups of 4, learners are required

*   to integrate the knowledge, skills and values learnt from the various disciplines;
*   to exemplify this integration through identification of problems, investigating them critically and inventing solutions to solve them;
*   to think about their own thinking to become more effective thinkers and learners.
