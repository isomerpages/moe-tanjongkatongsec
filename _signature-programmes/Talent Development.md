# Talent Development

TK offers a comprehensive Talent Development Programme that nurtures students' strengths and supports them in realising their fullest potential. Built on a clear and progressive framework, the programme adopts a school-wide approach with three tiers of development, ensuring that all students - regardless of their starting point - can discover, develop, and extend their talents in meaningful ways to become innovative and engaged learners.

**Tier 1: Experience** offers all students authentic and hands-on experience in the learning of different subjects to cultivate essential skills, such as innovative and adaptive thinking, while fostering creativity and collaboration, all of which are required for our rapidly evolving world.

**Tier 2: Enrich** exposes students to the subject, builds their interest by offering opportunities for interested students to participate in programmes such as the Einstein, DaVinci, and Tagore Programmes, either by signing up or through teacher nomination.

**Tier 3: Extend** stretches high-ability and talented students through specialised programmes such as the Core Programme for School-based Scholars, Einstein Plus, DaVinci Plus, and Tagore Plus. These programmes emphasise rigour in the learning process, provide mentorship by a teacher and/or an external organisation, and include deliverables such a presentation at the Learning Symposium organized by the school, along with requirements set by the organiser.

All students on the Principal’s Honours List, as well as all scholars, will participate in at least one of these Plus Programmes. Scholars are identified from the top 2–5% of students in each talent area, such as Mathematics and Science. They also undergo a rigorous selection process, which includes an interview conducted by a school panel comprising school leaders and members of the School Advisory Committee.
