# Talent Development

TK offers a comprehensive Talent Development Programme that nurtures students' strengths and supports them in realising their fullest potential. Built on a clear and progressive framework, the programme adopts a school-wide approach with three tiers of development, ensuring that all students - regardless of their starting point - can discover, develop, and extend their talents in meaningful ways to become innovative and engaged learners.

**Tier 1: Experience** offers all students authentic and hands-on experience in the learning of different subjects to cultivate essential skills, such as innovative and adaptive thinking, while fostering creativity and collaboration, all of which are required for our rapidly evolving world.

**Tier 2: Enrich** extends opportunities to interested students through programmes such as the Einstein, DaVinci, and Tagore Programmes, which they may join by signing up or through teacher nomination.

**Tier 3: Extend** supports high-ability and talented students through specialised programmes, including the Core Programme for Scholars, Einstein Plus, DaVinci Plus, and Tagore Plus. All students on the Principal’s Honours List will participate in at least one of these programmes. School-based scholars are identified from the top 2% to 5% of students in each talent area, such as Mathematics and Science. In addition, they undergo a rigorous selection process, which includes an interview conducted by a school panel comprising school leaders and members of the School Advisory Committee.
