# Einstein Programme
The Einstein Programme in TKSS aims to create a platform where students will be provided with opportunities to connect knowledge and skills across subject disciplines to propose and design solutions to solve real-world problems.

It incorporates the use of design thinking processes in problem-solving, dealing with ambiguity and assumptions to make informed decisions to identify solutions for the problems.

This programme aims to develop 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking skills in TKSS students. It will enable students to see relevance of their learning beyond the classroom to solving problems in real world contexts. Students will be engaged in the practical application of their knowledge and skills to propose solutions to address real-world problems. Through this programme, we also hope to encourage a culture of tinkering and making so as to develop the ‘create-innovate’, the ‘dare-to-try’ and ‘test-fail-try-again’ mind-sets in our students.

Students will be developed in their computational thinking processes; the thought process involved in formulating problems and developing approaches to solving them in a manner that can be implemented with an information-processing agent’ This process involves several problem-solving skills including abstraction, decomposition, generalisation and algorithmic thinking. With computational thinking skills, students will have the ability to decompose, generalise and understand problems that can be solved by computation and develop solutions to solve these problems.
