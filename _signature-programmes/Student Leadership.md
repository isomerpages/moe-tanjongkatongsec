# Student Leadership

**Leadership Philosophy**

 We believe that every TK student can and will rise to the occasion to take the lead. We strive to be an extraordinary school that nurtures leaders who will contribute to our school, nation and the global community.

**The Leadership Challenge Model**

 TK Student Leadership framework is derived from the theoretical underpinnings of The Leadership Challenge Model by Kouzes and Posner. The Five Practices of The Leadership Challenge Model are:

**FRAMEWORK**

**3 Facets of Leadership**

 The **Competent** facet aims to enable leaders to manage their soft skills as leaders which include, vision casting, rallying people through setting up clear aims and running projects, managing and ensuring the efficient execution of events/tasks.

The **Constructive** facet focuses on value adding to self and others in a position of leadership. Leaders are to grow in awareness of self and schoolmates. By heightening their personal awareness and empowering to positively influence both peers and juniors, they will grow as active contributors to create a positive and constructive school environment and culture.

The **Compassionate** facet focuses on the leaders’ growth in social awareness and sensitivity to the needs of others, harnessing the moral compass of every individual.

The TK student leader is the epitome of **Competence**, **Constructiveness** and **Compassion**.

**Guiding Principles**

*   Opportunity for all
*   Reflective learning
*   Developmental and progressive
*   Positive peer support and influence
*   Empowerment through ownership
*   Whole school approach through integration and collaboration
