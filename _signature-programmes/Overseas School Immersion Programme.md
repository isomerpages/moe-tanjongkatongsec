Tanjong Katong Secondary School (TKSS) is an autonomous Government School in Singapore, established in 1956. We seek to develop a holistic curriculum that is aligned to national and global imperatives, promote multi-culturalism and global awareness by , has ample overseas immersion opportunities, and emphasises awareness of current and global issues. We currently have strong existing partnerships with schools from countries such as Southeast Asia, and East Asia.

Developing a Global Citizen at TK is designed to provide TKsians with hands-on, real-world experiences beyond the confines of the classroom.

The goals of the programme would be to enable students to:

* possess a global outlook and operate within multi-national settings;
* be world-ready and culturally savvy – cognitively, physically and emotionally;
* be exposed to ASEAN countries and the world and develop empathy towards  living in  a global context;
* learn to appreciate other cultures and extend the friendship and understanding of peers in ASEAN countries;

The international immersive and exchange experiences enable our students to develop confidence, empathy and independence: as they experience new situations outside their comfort zones. Students can establish valuable friendships and deepen networks with their peers from overseas, potentially leading to lifelong friendships and opportunities. They also develop a deeper appreciation for diversity and  intercultural understanding, as they become more  exposed to diverse cultures and communities.

AT TK, we welcome partnerships with schools from ASEAN and East Asia countries/regions. If you are keen to partner us, do write to Mrs Tan Pei Shan at [teh\_pei\_shan@schools.gov.sg](mailto:teh_pei_shan@schools.gov.sg).
