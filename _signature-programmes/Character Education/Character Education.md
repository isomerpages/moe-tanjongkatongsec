**Character and Citizenship Education**

Key programmes in CCE (i.e. VIA, ECG, Student Leadership, Outdoor Education, National Education) are guided by the Co-curricular Programme (CCP) Framework.

At the heart of the framework, TK’s Vision, Mission, Values anchor CCE key programmes. The Socio-Emotional and 21CC competencies, underpinned by school values: **Respect**, **Responsibility**, **Resilience**, **Integrity** and **Compassion**.

We adopt the Head-Heart-Hand approach (Lickona, 1991) and aim to impart knowledge, inculcate values and motivate students to take the right actions.
