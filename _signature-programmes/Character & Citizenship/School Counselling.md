**What is counselling?**

Counselling involves providing a safe environment for students to share your challenges and work through your social, emotional, behavioural and mental health issues with a trained counsellor.

A Counsellor supports students by helping you learn and use strategies to manage and cope with your emotions or situation and enables you to make choices for positive change and development.

**Support and Referral Process**

There are 3 levels of counselling at TK:  
  
**1\. Support by teachers**  
Students are encouraged to talk to their Teachers who will provide the first level of support.   
  
**2\. Referral to counsellors**  
Students who need more specialised attention may be referred to a teacher-counsellor or school counsellor who will provide early intervention for students facing social, emotional or mental health challenges.

Tier 2 Counselling is provided by the following:

*   **School Counsellors** who are professional counsellors with either a Diploma, Bachelor or Master Degree in Counselling.
*   **Teacher-Counsellors (TC)** who are trained on in counselling skills including and in areas such as suicide intervention, grief and loss counselling, and psychological first aid.

**What happens when you see a Counsellor?**

During the counselling session, the counsellor will explore your concerns and various coping strategies with you so that you can try what works best for you. Together, you will tap on your strengths and resources to customize strategies to build your mental well-being.

The Counselling sessions are CONFIDENTIAL and this means:

*   It will not be reported in your report book, stay in your records that may affect your future, nor shared with anybody. 
*   However, for your safety, your school counsellor will be required to share the information that puts yourself or someone else at risk of being harmed.
