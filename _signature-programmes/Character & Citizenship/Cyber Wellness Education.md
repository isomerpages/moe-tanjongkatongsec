# Cyber Wellness Education

<p style="text-align: center;"><b> Overview of Cyber Wellness Education at TK </b></p>

TK adopts MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework in educating our students on Cyber Wellness.&nbsp;

**_Through CW education, students learn to be respectful, safe, and responsible users of technology and be a positive peer influence, advocating for the good of the community online._**

In order for our students to be equipped with knowledge and skills to navigate cyber space with discernment and empathy, varied opportunities are offered for students to practice their learnings through related experiences where they analyse, evaluate and reflect on Cyber Wellness issues. We aim to partner parents in playing an integral role to reinforce the messages shared in school and through partnership with external agencies to support families. 

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>3-TIERED APPROACH FOR CYBER WELLNESS EDUCATION @ TK</b></p>

The 3-tiered approach allows differentiated experiences across groups of students with segmented needs. This provides students with opportunities to demonstrate their understanding of knowledge and skills learnt, and put to practice their actions as responsible digital users. Such platforms also allow students to translate their understanding into actions that will keep them safe while online and offline.

The school experiences under different tiers reinforce and extend the learning from the following themes and topics which are taught during CCE Lessons for Cyber Wellness.
