key programmes. The Socio-Emotional and 21CC competencies, underpinned
by school values:&nbsp;<strong>Respect</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Responsibility</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Resilience</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Integrity</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Compassion</strong>.</p>
<p>We adopt the Head-Heart-Hand approach (Lickona, 1991) and aim to impart
knowledge, inculcate values and motivate students to take the right actions.</p>

<p><u>Centre of Excellence for Character &amp; Citizenship Education (Year of inception- 2011)</u>
</p>
<p>Tanjong Katong Secondary School is proud to have been selected in 2011
to be one of the three schools in the East Zone to host the EZ Centre of
Excellence for CCE. Leading the zone in Character and Citizenship Education,
the school has organized and hosted a number of CCE seminars, Brown Bag
Sessions and Coffee &amp; Connect Sessions where schools shared their best
practices in the implementation of the CCE curriculum over the years.</p>
<p>The COE model was reviewed for its relevance and strategic value in view
of the evolving needs in teaching and learning. Hence, the COE model for
East Zone will cease with effect from 1 January 2022.</p>
<p>Moving forward, our distinctive strengths in CCE will continue to be harnessed
to strengthen teaching and learning capabilities and foster a collaborative
and learning culture in the East Zone.</p>
<p>Together, the programmes in CCE develop our students to become the TK
Graduate:</p>
<p><strong>“The TK Graduate is self-directed in learning and passionate in all he undertakes. Confident, resilient and flexible, he is guided by sound values to lead and contribute to school, nation and the global community.”</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>TK Graduate Assessment</strong>
</p>
<p>The purpose of the TK Graduate Assessment is to help students understand
their strengths and areas for improvement and work towards the outcomes
of a TK Graduate.</p>
<p>The guiding Principles of TK Graduate Assessment are as follows:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students can benefit from the process of assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students can apply feedback and make improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple perspectives are obtained on a student over various platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behavioural outcomes are observable through identified assessment platforms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The TK Graduate Assessment is on-going and conducted through a variety
of platforms and by different assessors to obtain a holistic view of students.
It gives students a picture of where they are at a particular point in
time, and the rubrics suggest how they can develop themselves in the light
of the next milestone.</p>
<p>Through feedback from teachers and peers, students better understand their
strengths and areas they can further work upon. The multiple perspective
approach, via teacher, peer and self-assessment, provides a more holistic
set of feedback for each student. This information allows the student to
take ownership of his own learning and plan how to further develop himself
through reflection and future action. The form and co-form teachers then
use the TK Graduate Assessment rubrics during TSR to discuss identified
areas for improvement with their students.</p>
<p>Students are assessed developmentally for the following six Personal Qualities,
which are aligned to the five TK Graduate Outcomes below.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Qualities (PQs)</strong>
