<p><strong>RELEASE OF 2024 SINGAPORE-CAMBRIDGE GCE O-LEVEL EXAMINATION RESULTS, 10 JANUARY (FRIDAY)</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students will return to school on 10 Jan 2025 (Friday) to receive your
GCE-O results in the hall at 2.30pm. You must report in full school uniform
(this will be the last chance for you to dress up with a common identity
- Team TK), proper hairstyles (short and neat and no coloured hair) and
white-based shoes and white socks. You will be denied entry if your decorum
does not meet the school requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to space constraints, we will not be able to accommodate to any request
for carpark on that day. Do inform your parents/guardians regarding this
matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who are unwell should not return to school to collect their results.
You will receive an email on your eligibility to participate in the JAE
on the afternoon of the day of O-Level results release.</p>
<p>If you are eligible for JAE, the same email will include Form A which
has:</p>
<p>• Your gross aggregate scores for JC, MI, polytechnic and ITE aggregate
types.</p>
<p>• The courses that you are eligible to apply in the JAE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School candidates who are unable to collect their results in person can
also appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results on their
behalf from the school. Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents
for the school’s verification when collecting the results. School candidates
may contact their schools for assistance if they are unable to appoint
a proxy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please also inform Mdm Halilah if you cannot come to school on 10 Jan
(Friday) to collect your results slip due to any other reason(s).</p>
