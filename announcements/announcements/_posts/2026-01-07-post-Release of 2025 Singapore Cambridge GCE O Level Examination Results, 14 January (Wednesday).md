<h4>To our class of 2025,</h4>
<p>The 2025 Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level Examination Results will be released
on 14 Jan 2026 (Wednesday) at 2pm. You are to report to the School Hall
by 1.30pm in full school uniform, with proper hairstyle (neat and no coloured
hair) and white-based shoes and white socks to receive your results slip.
Do note that you will be denied entry to the School Hall if you are not
properly attired or neat in your appearance.</p>
<p>More importantly, if you are not able to collect your results slip in
person, you may appoint a proxy to collect the physical copy of your results
slip on your behalf. Please note that your proxy is required to produce
the relevant documents for the school’s verification. Do contact Mdm Halilah
at <a href="mailto:halilah_salim_alkhatib@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">halilah_salim_alkhatib@moe.edu.sg</a> if
you are not able to come to school to collect your results slip on 14 Jan
and/or require assistance if you are unable to appoint a proxy.</p>
<p>Last but not least, if your parents are coming with you and are driving,
do help inform them that there is limited parking facilities within the
school, and to park their vehicle at the public carpark at the HBD blocks
at Haig Road.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you again on 14 Jan.</p>
<p></p>
