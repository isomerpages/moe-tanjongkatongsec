<p><strong>Application for Direct School Admission-Secondary (DSA-Sec) 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>Introduced in 2004, DSA-Sec is a pathway for students to gain admission
to secondary schools based on their interests, aptitude, and potential,
beyond their performance at Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).
For the 2025 DSA-Sec exercise to gain admission to Secondary 1 in TK in
2026, TK offers five talent areas under two domain areas.</p>

<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on
the following:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aptitudes and strengths, bearing
in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; programmes available to develop
the area(s) of talent.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;DSA-Sec Selection Criteria and Process</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who do not have prior experience in the DSA talent area(s) may
also apply. All applicants will be assessed based on the selection criteria,
which may include assessing the potential of your child, as detailed in
the table below.</p>
<p>Meeting all the criteria does not guarantee that the student will be shortlisted
or given an offer.</p>
<p>Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected
to honour their commitment to the school and participate in the activities
related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.</p>
