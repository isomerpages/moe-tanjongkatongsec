## **About**

Guiding is an educational youth movement. It is open to all girls without distinction of creed, race, nationality or any other circumstance.

Guiding is a game of adventure, observation, knowledge and ideas. It is an education in life skills that will encourage each girl to be a responsible citizen and to lead a useful life.

The aim is to provide girls with the opportunity for self-training in the development of character, in realisation of citizenship and promotion of service to the community.
