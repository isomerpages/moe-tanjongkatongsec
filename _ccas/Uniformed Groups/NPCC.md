## **Mission & Beliefs**

#### Mission

Established in 1971, the TK NPCC Unit aims to mould builders of a safe and secure home. We strive to develop our members to be active and community leaders, by working in partnership with the Singapore Police Force to fight crime and keep Singapore safe.

#### Beliefs

We believe in:

*   Developing leaders with character and values. Ensure our growth by exposing us to a challenging environment, which in turn will imbibe us with leadership qualities, strong character and civic, social and moral values.
*   Building bonds with Singapore Police Force. Enlighten us on the role of the Singapore Police Force, help to build a stronger bond of friendship with them, and so lead to a safer place for all in the country.
*   Showing care and concern to others. As part of a culture that encourages us to treat fellow cadets with respect, courtesy and tact, teach us to extend the same care and concern to others.
*   Facing challenges and achieving excellence. As a result of our identification with the Singapore Police Force, NPCC teaches us to adopt its tradition of high standards of performance, commitment to duty and service, to seek, to excel and to face up to challenges.

## **Activities**

In accordance to the NPCC Training Framework stipulated by NPCC HQ, the key areas of emphasis in our training include law enforcement, national education, leadership, resilience, personal development, character development, innovation and enterprise. From the time a cadet is enrolled in NPCC, he will undergo structured training to acquire skills and knowledge that will help him thrive in 21st century.

Our visits include:

*   Crime Scene Investigation

#### Visits

NPCC organises annual educational visits for our cadets and members. NPCC cadets and members have the opportunity to network, not just locally, but into foreign lands as well. The purpose of the visit is to broaden the mental horizon of our cadets and members through first-hand knowledge of the economic, social and cultural aspects of the host country. The educational visits focus mainly on regional Asian countries that have similar set-up as the NPCC so that our cadets are further exposed to the Police-Youth partnership programme in other countries.

Overseas Education Visits organised by NPCC HQ include Hong Kong, Macau, Shanghai and Brunei.

TK NPCC also organises an annual Leadership and Adventure overseas camp for cadet leaders. The aim is to offer our cadets a different type of outdoor experience and develop their leadership skills, teamwork and resilience. Countries visited include Australia and Malaysia.
