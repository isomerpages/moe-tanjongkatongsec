## **About**

<p style="text-align: justify;">TK NCC (Land) aims to maintain its status as a quality Gold Unit, having consistently attained the Distinction award in the Unit Recognition award (BUC) over the years, every year. Aside from its achievements in the Unit Recognition award and various Inter-Unit Competitions such as the Annual Orienteering Competition and Precision Drill Squad Competition, TK NCC (Land) also strives to give cadets an enriching and enjoyable CCA experience. Every year, selected NCC (Land) cadets will go to various countries such as New Zealand, Australia, India and more to experience and learn the different cultures in the other countries. Through a varied training programme, cadets develop physically and mentally to become rugged individuals, as well as outstanding and dedicated leaders.</p>

“We strive to be the best. Nothing more, nothing less.”
