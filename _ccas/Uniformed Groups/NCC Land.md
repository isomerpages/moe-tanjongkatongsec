## **About**

<p style="text-align: justify;">        

TK NCC (Land) consistently upholds its status as a quality Gold Unit, having earned the Distinction award in the Unit Recognition (UR) Award every year. Beyond these achievements in the UR Award and various Inter-Unit Competitions such as the Annual Freestyle Drill and Precision Drill Squad Competitions, TK NCC (Land) is committed to providing cadets with an enriching and enjoyable CCA experience. Each year, selected NCC (Land) cadets have the opportunity to travel to countries like New Zealand, Australia, India, and more, where they experience and learn about different cultures. Through a well-rounded training programme, cadets develop both physically and mentally, growing into rugged individuals as well as outstanding and dedicated leaders.</p>
