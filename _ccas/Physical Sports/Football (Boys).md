## **About**

TK Football aims not only to develop students in their skills and playing acumen, but also to nurture students with the right values to succeed outside the football pitch.

This philosophy is perfectly encapsulated in the team motto, which emphasises that success is always within one’s reach but one&nbsp;must have the character to work hard and seize it.

We also believe in giving the students opportunities to contribute and make a difference, which explains our involvement in Community Involvement Projects, such as TK’s Project Serve, and the launch of the Good Goal Initiative in 2011.

Key objectives:

*   To better understand, appreciate and enjoy the game.
*   To inculcate the right values for success in all aspects.
*   To nurture potential and instil discipline.
*   To equip the students to do their best in competition.

“TK FOOTBALL – the audacity to aspire to victory: DARE TO WIN!”

Mr Roy Soh
