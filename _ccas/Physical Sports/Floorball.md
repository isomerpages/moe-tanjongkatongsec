## **About**

TK Floorball aims to develop not only the girls’ technicalities, but also strongly believe in character building. Through the programme planned for them, we hope to develop every member to become a confident, resilient and flexible person. At the same time, understand the importance of respect and teamwork.

Although TK Floorball is only three years old, this year has been a memorable season for our girls. Both our B and C girls fought hard and successfully made it through to the finals of this year’s 2013 ‘B’ and ‘C’ Girls National Inter-School Floorball Tournament. Besides taking part in Inter-Schools tournament, we also took part in various floorball tournament such as Tampines West CSC 3v3 and Division 2 League to ensure they have sufficient exposure and learning experiences.

Training takes place twice a week (Monday & Thursday) in the school hall, and training hours last about 3hrs per session from 3:30-6:30pm.

“When the going gets tough, the tough get going.”
