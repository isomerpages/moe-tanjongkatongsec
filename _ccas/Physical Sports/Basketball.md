## **About**

Basketball has been an effective CCA for teambuilding, trust and friendship. It has developed discipline, determination, resilience, tactical skills and passion for the sport through regular training, friendly games and competitive matches.

Our boys give off their best in every competition. It is for love of the game, and the honour of wearing the jersey bearing ‘Tanjong Katong Secondary School’.

“There may be people that have more talent than you, but there’s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.”

Derek Jeter

“We don’t quit, We don’t cower, We don’t run. We endure and conquer it all.”

Muhd Naqib Bin Borhan (3G)
