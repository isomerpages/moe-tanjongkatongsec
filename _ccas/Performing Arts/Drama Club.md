# Drama Club


## **About**

Drama allows you to express your feelings and be spontaneous. It is an avenue to expand your creativity and look within yourself for answers. The Drama Club finds opportunities for its members to go on stage by participating in school concerts, public speaking competitions and doing public performances.

“Centre stage. A single spotlight. It’s our glorious moment; it’s our time to shine!”

Siti Nur Sabrina Bte Yusri (3C)
