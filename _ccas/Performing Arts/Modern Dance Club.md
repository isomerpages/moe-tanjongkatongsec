# Modern Dance Club

The TK Modern Dance Club aims to develop each dancer holistically through the art of dance. Beyond just physical movement, dancers in the club cultivate important life skills such as perseverance, collaboration, and creativity. Through the various platforms provided, the Modern Dance Club ensures that each dancer grows both as an artist and as an individual, ready to take on challenges with creativity and resilience.

Over their four-year journey with the club, members will participate in a variety of enriching activities, including:

<u>SYF Arts Presentation for Dance</u><br>
An opportunity for dancers to showcase their talents at a national level, participating in this prestigious event helps build confidence and teamwork as they prepare for a large-scale performance.

<u>School-Based Performances</u><br>
Dancers will contribute to the school's vibrant cultural landscape, performing at key school events and celebrations. These performances are a platform for dancers to share their passion with the school community and refine their stage presence.

<u>Community-Based Performances</u><br>
Taking their skills beyond the school, members also perform for community events, offering them a chance to connect with a broader audience and learn the value of giving back through art.

<u>VIA (Values in Action) Engagement with the Community</u><br>
Through dance, members engage in VIA projects, using their talents to inspire and support the community. These experiences help dancers develop empathy and social responsibility while fostering stronger connections with society.
