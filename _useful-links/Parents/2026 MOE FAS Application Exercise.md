# 2026 MOE FAS Application Exercise

Dear Parents / Guardians

With reference to the Parents Gateway message sent by MOE on 17 October 2025 regarding the revised income eligibility criteria and enhanced provisions for MOE financial assistance schemes, please be informed that applications may now be submitted through the following FormSG link below.

[https://go.gov.sg/moe-efasggas](https://go.gov.sg/moe-efasggas) or via Parentâ€™s Gateway App services.

If you have any queries, please contact the school at Tel: 6344 3471 or you can email us at [tkss@moe.edu.sg](mailto:tkss@moe.edu.sg).

Alternatively, you can download the MOE FAS application form or collect a copy at the General Office and submit the completed form directly to the school.

Tip: If you have children in different government or government-aided schools, you just need to submit 1 application form to any of their schools. The school that receives the application form will inform you of the outcome.

Thank you.

Yours faithfully<br>
Tanjong Katong Secondary School<br>
General Office<br>
