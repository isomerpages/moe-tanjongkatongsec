The Leave of Absence (LOA) scheme allows your child to rejoin their school after they return from overseas.

If your child is granted LOA, they will remain as a registered student of the school. They can then be re-admitted to the school directly after returning to Singapore.

**Eligibility**

The LOA scheme applies to all Singapore Citizen (SC) and Permanent Resident (PR) children studying in primary schools, secondary schools, junior colleges and Millennia Institute.

To be granted LOA, your child must fulfil the following criteria:  
1. Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident  
2. Presently studying in a Singapore school  
3. Accompanying you on an overseas posting with the intention of re-joining the school after  
returning to Singapore  
Or  
4. Child is already registered for Secondary 1 but will be overseas at the start of the year

**Application**

Applicants are to submit the online [LOA application form](https://go.gov.sg/tkss-loa). Please prepare the following information before you proceed with the LOA application:
1. Student information i.e Full Name, NRIC/BC Number
2. Parent information i.e Full Name, NRIC/FIN/Passport Number  
3. LOA period and reason  
4. Softcopy of supporting document(s) for the LOA application

The school may contact you for additional clarification and/or documents (if required). Please note that the LOA application is subject to the Principal’s approval, and the school will notify you of the outcome. Schools will charge an annual nominal fee for a child on LOA. For LOA periods of less than a year, the annual LOA fee will be pro-rated accordingly.

Upon successful application, the school will advise on the payment procedure for LOA fee.

All successful LOA applications will expire at the end of the year and you will need to inform the school in November if you wish to renew the LOA for another year. Your child’s LOA status will expire if you choose not to renew.
