<p><strong><u>School Insurance For Students &amp; Insurance Claims Procedures</u></strong>
</p>
<p>GROUP PERSONAL ACCIDENT (GPA) INSURANCE FOR STUDENTS:</p>
<p>All students are covered under the GPA Insurance Plan which provides 24-hour
worldwide accident coverage while they are at the school premises (including
school-based Student Care Centre), in Singapore or elsewhere, participating
in school-related activities, including Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)
and sports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a Group Personal Accident (GPA) Insurance which covers death,
permanent and total/partial disability and medical expenses due to an accident.
The proximate or triggering causes of injuries must be reasonably attributed
to an accident.</p>
<p>Parents/guardian will have to pay for medical treatments upfront, before
submitting claims to Income Insurance Limited (Income Insurance) for reimbursement.
Please note the applicable limits and coverage for medical expenses. Ineligible
expenses or expenses in excess of the limits will be borne by the students/parents/guardian.</p>
<p>Parents/guardian should also take note that medical treatments at private
hospitals will typically cost higher, and parents/guardian may need to
pay more out-of-pocket expenses if treatment costs exceed the policy’s
coverage limits.</p>
