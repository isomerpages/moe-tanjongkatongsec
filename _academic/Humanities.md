# Humanities
The Humanities Department represent a committed and passionate group of educators who are always ready to impart their experience and expertise in the areas of Geography, History and Social Studies. We seek to bring to life theoretical knowledge which in turn, inspired our learners to take on the like-minded keenness and curiosity to seek relevance in these subjects they immerse themselves in.

As a department, we seek to continuously update ourselves in terms of pedagogical understanding and curriculum information and knowledge. We understand the shift in education paradigm, and see ourselves as co-learners in this rapidly changing world, yet bearing in mind the critical role we play in preparing our students well for the challenges in the real world.

The Humanities subjects explore the interactions between man and the physical and human environments, the past, the present and the lessons for the future. To appreciate the complexities of human relationships and experiences in today’s rapid changing world, it is timely to introduce the process of learning Humanities through inquiry. In the learning of concepts, skills, and exploration of issues, the inquiry approach is a pedagogy recommended for all humanities subjects. It comprises three key areas: elements of inquiry, process of inquiry and culture of inquiry.

The new inquiry approach encourages our students to embark on deep questioning, investigation and critical thinking about issues affecting the environment and people’s lives. Learning experiences in class will be structured to (1) spark curiosity (2) gather data, both primary data through field work and secondary data through research (3) exercise reasoning and (4) engage in reflective thinking.

With the focus on contemporary real world issues through inquiry in the Humanities, it provides ample scope and opportunities for Self-Directed Learning (SDL) and Collaborative Learning ( CoL); such competencies are invaluable in preparing our students for the future.
