<u>Vision</u>

Every TKsian a global citizen who is an insightful and confident user of English

<u>Mission</u>

The English Language and Literature Department strives to nurture TKsians to be critical thinkers, and life-long and self-directed learners who are confident writers and speakers. We also aim to ignite a spark of curiosity about pertinent global issues, as well as to cultivate an appreciation for the beauty of the English language.

We provide a holistic and student-centric English Language learning experience infused with Differentiated Instruction and Assessment for Learning strategies. Students learn how to communicate and collaborate confidently, effectively and sensitively to co-construct knowledge. In addition, they will gather and synthesise information from diverse sources to co-create knowledge and solutions in familiar or new contexts thoughtfully and nimbly.
