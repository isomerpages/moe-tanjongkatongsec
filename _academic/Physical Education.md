# Physical Education
**Vision**

The purpose of physical education is to enable students to demonstrate individually and with others the physical skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.

**Mission**

TK PE curriculum aims to enhance student learning to facilitate the confidence and positive attitude necessary for a successful transition from the physical education setting to participation in physical activity during adulthood.

**Goals of PE**

**Goal 1:** Acquire a range of motor skills to participate in a variety of physical activities.

**Goal 2:** Understand and apply movement concepts, principles and strategies in a range of physical activities.

**Goal 3:** Demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily activities with respect to themselves, others and the environment

**Goal 4:** Display positive personal and social behaviour across different experiences

**Goal 5:** Acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness through regular participation in physical activities.

**Goal 6:** Enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life.

**Physical Education Framework**

Our PE syllabus is organised to achieve the goals of PE based on the framework below. At the apex is the purpose of PE, achieved through the seven learning areas to produce effective, efficient and versatile movers. Learning in the affective areas and competencies for the 21st century are both the outcomes and pre-requisites for the learning of PE. Through a balanced and well-designed curriculum, delivered through appropriate and effective pedagogies and meaningful assessment, students will acquire the knowledge, skills and values to live active and healthy lives.

**TK PE Syllabus**

TK PE Syllabus focuses on the dispositions, movement skilis, and knowledge components of physical education. It targets the three different domains (psychomotor, cognitive, affective) through three different approaches: Games and Sports, Outdoor Education (OE) and Physical Health and Fitness (PHF).TK’s unique Sports Science curriculum,  which will cover most of the components  from OE and PHF, will leverage on the IT knowledge of this new generation of students to gain further insights on the meaning and purpose of physical education.

**Games & Sports**

Games and sports promote the students’ playful tendency to control objects and the body during the early stages of learning. Early movement experiences, practised individually and in cooperative relationships with others, help develop competency and confidence in critical elements of discrete motor skills that progressively lead toward mature patterns. Skills practised in combination and incorporating movement concepts are essential before application across a broad range of formalised but simplified game-like activities. Games­ related concepts such as the use of space, maintaining possession, creating attack, organising defence, and defending space and running to bases are consciously weaved into appropriate teacher-structured game situations, together with an emphasis on the learning and demonstration of values like integrity, respect and sportsmanship. A range of game play experiences from territorial-invasion, net-barrier, striking-fielding, and other games encourages students’ safe and maximal participation, with modification to game rules to match and enhance their developing skills and understanding.

TK PE syllabus builds on the foundation for quality movement laid at the primary level to enhance students’ mature performance across different specialised situations and physical activities, so that students become competent and enthusiastic athletes. Various physical activities have been offered (of which at least one from each game category, i.e., territorial-invasion, net-barrier and striking-fielding). Students from each level will have an opportunity to choose from the following game options

*   Sec 1s: Basketball, Football, Frisbee,
*   Sec 2s: Badminton, Netball, Softball
*   Sec 3s: Floorball, Touch Rugby, Volleyball
*   Sec 4s: Badminton, Softball, Volleyball

**Assessment**  
All students will be assessed in the game that they have opted for in each Semester. Students will be involved in the assessment process which includes self and peer assessment. Our objectives of assessment serves both as a formative tool for learning as well as provide a summative assessment of students’ skill attainment level at the end of each sports module.

**Outdoor Education**

Outdoor education engages the students’ sense of adventure through the exploration of both natural and urban environments from their immediate surroundings to other unfamiliar locations. Physical activities are promoted as students develop appropriate outdoor skills while cultivating an attitude of care and appreciation for the environment, and thoughtful consideration of the risks and safety of self and others. Young learners maximise the use of their senses to be comfortable as they explore familiar surroundings. New and unfamiliar locations, in diverse natural and urban environments, provide dynamic situations for mature learners to learn to be safe and make good judgments in a wider range of activities. These exploratory experiences will also enable students to develop connections with the environment and the responsibility to safeguard it, thereby facilitating a lifelong pursuit of outdoor physical recreation.

**Physical** **Health** **&** **Fitness**

Physical health and fitness stimulates students’ interest in physical activity by making meaningful connections between health concepts and practical applications through experiential learning. For the younger learners, regular and purposeful health- enhancing physical activities and learning tasks that nurture understanding of good health practices in nutrition, exercise, safety and hygiene are used to facilitate their learning. Fun activities promote a positive attitude towards continual participation in physical activities for health, fitness and enjoyment. As students mature, the focus is on developing self- directed learners who see meaning in their sustained physical endeavours. They pursue physical activities that interest them and possess both the ability and willingness to accept responsibility for personal health and fitness. Students evaluate their lifestyles and adapt their participation in physical activities at different stages of their lives with understanding of the health  benefits derived, and how living active and healthy lives is connected with the world around them and the health of others.

**Exercise and Sports Science (ESS – Syllabus 6081)**

TK is one of the few schools in Singapore that offers ESS as an O-level subject. Students who opt for the subject can use it to apply for admission to junior college, just as they would with other ‘O’ level academic subjects. It offers students a chance to build a strong foundation for pursuing a sports-related degree or diploma. And even if they choose not to go down this path, the subject offers benefits in other areas.

Exercise and Sports Science (ESS) is an interdisciplinary subject where students will be grounded in the sub-disciplines of sports science with an understanding of sociology in relation to sports. Through the study of ESS, students will develop disciplinary thinking and practices of the subject and thus interdisciplinary understanding

**Aims of the Syllabus**

**The aims of the syllabus are for students to:**

1.  **Acquire and apply the knowledge in exercise physiology, biomechanics, and sports psychology to analyse, evaluate and improve practical performances in physical exercises and sports;**
2.  **Develop the movement concepts and motor skills to be proficient in the performance of a team and an individual / dual sport;**
3.  **Understand the benefits and risks associated with physical exercise and sports to manage personal participation in physical activities; and**
4.  **Examine issues related to sports and participation in physical activities from sociocultural and global perspectives. Assessment**

**Practical** **component** **(60%):**

As part of the coursework requirement, students will choose ONE practical activity from EACH of the categories below;

1) An Individual / Dual Activity; and
