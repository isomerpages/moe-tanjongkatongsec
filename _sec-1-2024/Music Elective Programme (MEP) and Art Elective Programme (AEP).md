# Music Elective Programme (MEP) and Art Elective Programme (AEP)

If your child/ ward exhibits interest and passion for Art or Music, they can apply for Art Elective Programme (AEP) or Music Elective Programme (MEP) and lessons will be conducted in the following centres:

*   AEP Centre (National Junior College)
*   MEP Centres (Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) or Dunman High School)

Successful applicants will attend weekly lessons in the afternoon at the AEP/MEP Centres. In view of the extended Art/Music curriculum, AEP/MEP students will not be offered Design and Technology (D&T) and Food and Consumer Education (FCE) at the Lower Secondary level to ensure that their overall curriculum load is manageable.

The online application is usually done at the beginning of each academic year.
