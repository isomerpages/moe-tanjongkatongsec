# Alumni
The term “alma mater’ is Latin for “nourishing mother”. In TK, we encourage our alumni to come back to their TK and strengthen bonds developed while they were in school TK believes in working closely with our alumni through the formation of synergistic partnerships

TK Alumni provide strong support in key areas such as our Co-Curricular Activities, Work Experience Programme as well as National Education. Our students are provided with opportunities for work attachment at firms in various fields of interest. Our students also attend career talks and dialogue sessions with members of alumni who are professionals in their respective fields of work. The alumni also organise events to raise funds for the School.

The alumni are kept updated on the school achievements through various methods of communication such as the bi-annual newsletter called Communicare, via emails and Facebook.

In TK, the Alumni Committee comprises dedicated and committed members who work closely with the School in harnessing the positive effects of this synergistic partnership  The office bearers of this Committee are as follows

*   Mr Lee Kai Hung – President ([lee\_kai\_hung@yahoo.com](mailto:lee_kai_hung@yahoo.com))

*   Mr Wee Ban Hong
*   Mr Lee Quek Eng

**Join us as TK Alumni!**

Every year, the school organises activities to bring alumni, parents and other stakeholders together. We welcome alumni to join us for various school events such as the TK Sports Day as well as the annual TK Golf Tournament as a means of integrating the various interest groups as one alumni body.

We encourage our alumni to be involved in the school community as this would contribute in enhancing the quality of education. We also welcome those who wish to form groups according to their year of graduation or receive updates on the school’s progress   They may contact our teacher in-charge of alumni liaison.
