# Alumni
The term “alma mater’ is Latin for “nourishing mother”. In TK, we encourage our alumni to come back to their TK and strengthen bonds developed while they were in school TK believes in working closely with our alumni through the formation of synergistic partnerships

TK Alumni provide strong support in key areas such as our Co-Curricular Activities, Work Experience Programme as well as National Education. Our students are provided with opportunities for work attachment at firms in various fields of interest. Our students also attend career talks and dialogue sessions with members of alumni who are professionals in their respective fields of work. The alumni also organise events to raise funds for the School.

The alumni are kept updated on the school achievements through various methods of communication such as the bi-annual newsletter called Communicare, via emails and Facebook.

In TK, the Alumni Committee comprises dedicated and committed members who work closely with the School in harnessing the positive effects of this synergistic partnership  The office bearers of this Committee are as follows

*   Mr Lee Kai Hung – President ([lee\_kai\_hung@yahoo.com](mailto:lee_kai_hung@yahoo.com))
*   Mr Jeffrey Lee
*   Mr Wee Ban Hong
*   Mr Lee Quek Eng

**Join us as TK Alumni!**

Every year, the school organises activities to bring alumni, parents and other stakeholders together. We welcome alumni to join us for various school events such as the TK Sports Day as well as the annual TK Golf Tournament as a means of integrating the various interest groups as one alumni body.

We encourage our alumni to be involved in the school community as this would contribute in enhancing the quality of education. We also welcome those who wish to form groups according to their year of graduation or receive updates on the school’s progress   They may contact our teacher in-charge of alumni liaison.

**TK Gives Backs**

The inaugural TK Gives Back Day 2014 saw alumni from the batch of 1960s to 2013 come together to collectively Walk For Rice in support of the South East CDC. Joined by alumni Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister of Culture, Community and Youth, TK Gives Back saw hundreds of alumni, students and staff (from the past and present), walked around the streets of Tanjong Katong Road, Dunman Road and Mountbatten Road. The morning walk was made enriching with students trail guides, who planned activities at various stations. The trail included walking passed the old site of Tanjong Katong Secondary Technical School, Sin Po Po Bar, Nam Seng Bird Trading, Katong News Agency and the Katong Post Office.

From TK Gives Back Day, staff, students and alumni raised 10659 bowls of rice for the needy in South East CDC.  Well done, Team TK!
