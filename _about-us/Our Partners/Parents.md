<h4><strong>TK Parent Support Group (PSG)</strong></h4>
<p>Guided by the school’s vision for partnership,<strong> “The Power of We – Nurturing Aspirations through Partnerships”</strong>,
and anchored in the values of open communication, mutual respect and shared
responsibility, the TK Parent Support Group (PSG) has a strong synergistic
and collaborative relationship with the school to support the students’
holistic growth since its formation in December 2000.</p>
<p>Made up of parents who believe that parents are an integral part of the
TK community and play an important role in working collaboratively with
the school to co-create memorable student learning experiences that support
their children’s learning and growth. Through their active involvement,
the TK PSG provides strong support for some of the school’s key school
programmes and events. These include NE events such as the International
Friendship Day and Racial Harmony Day, and milestone events for students
such as Secondary 1 Investiture and Secondary 4 Graduation Tea.</p>
<p>The above complements platforms that the school has to reach out to TK
parents, such as level Parent Engagement sessions, where parents can look
forward to meaningful conversations with School Leaders and Form Teachers
of their child on ways to strengthen the support for their child’s holistic
learning and development.</p>
<p>There are many opportunities for parents to be involved in their child’s
learning in TK, as well as opportunities for parents to connect with each
other. Parents who are keen to contribute to the TK community are encouraged
to join the TK PSG, and to find out more, do write to <a href="mailto:psgtkss@gmail.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">psgtkss@gmail.com</a>.</p>
