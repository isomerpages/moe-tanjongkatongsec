# Our Partners

In TK, our partnership vision is “The Power of We – Nurturing Aspirations through Partnerships” and it is with this in mind that we forge synergistic collaborations with our parents  Several platforms exist for us to harness the positive effects of such a partnership.

**Parents’** **Days**

A regular feature in the school calendar, the TK Parents’ Day is an event which is organised by academic level.

It provides parents with opportunities to communicate personally with the teachers in areas pertaining to their children’s progress and conduct. This event also enables the School to provide current updates to parents on pertinent matters such as the School Direction and Focus, as well as the programmes that their children will engage in as we move in tandem towards providing a holistic education.

**Parent Support** **Group**

The TK Parent Support Group is an active body of parent volunteers who work hand-in-hand with the School in realising her vision of providing value-adding, all-round and global-oriented education. Formed in December 2000, the TK PSG seeks to support the school in a strategic partnership through a two-pronged approach:

1\. Working with parents directly, and

2\. Supporting and value-adding to school programmes

The TK PSG is actively involved in organising PSG events such as the Food, Fun and Friendship (F3). It also provides strong support at school events such as the Racial Harmony Day Celebrations and Teachers’ Day Celebrations, among others.

At TK, there are many opportunities for you to stay connected and support your child’s learning. Do consider to INVEST some of your time to connect with your child and involve in school events and activities.

The School was awarded the COMPASS Partners Award (Outstanding) \[2004-2015\] in the year 2004. This award was given in recognition of the TK PSG’s active and committed involvement in the School and is valid for five years.

Some of activities we have participated in are shown here.
