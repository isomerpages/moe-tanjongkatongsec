On the school badge is a picture of Leonardo da Vinci, one of the most versatile geniuses of modern times. He was both a scientist and an artist. Leonardo represents a man with an ‘all-round’ education. The symbolism of “flight” in the school’s emblem, seen in the bird and the flying machine, instills in the students the desire to go beyond the realms of ordinary imagination and to achieve goals, which no one has dared to dream before.

The school motto in Latin: Diligentia, Ingenium and Dexteritas.

It highlights the importance of the meaning of these words:&nbsp;**Diligence**,&nbsp;**Ingenuity**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Dexterity**

**Diligence**    
is the willingness to persevere with tenacity.

**Ingenuity**  
is embracing the spirit of being innovative, taking initiative and showing resourcefulness.

**Dexterity**  
is about having the agility of mind to respond to changing conditions and circumstances.
