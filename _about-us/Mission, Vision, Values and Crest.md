<p>On the school badge is a picture of Leonardo da Vinci, one of the most
versatile geniuses of modern times. He was both a scientist and an artist.
Leonardo represents a man with an ‘all-round’ education. The symbolism
of “flight” in the school’s emblem, seen in the bird and the flying machine,
instills in the students the desire to go beyond the realms of ordinary
imagination and to achieve goals, which no one has dared to dream before.</p>
<p>The school motto in Latin: Diligentia, Ingenium and Dexteritas.</p>
