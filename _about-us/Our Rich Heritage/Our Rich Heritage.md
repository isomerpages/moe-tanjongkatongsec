# Our Rich Heritage
Founded in 1956, Tanjong Katong Secondary School began its life as a pioneer technical school along Tanjong Katong Road, known then as Tanjong Katong Secondary Technical School. It was an institution of choice for boys in the East.

In the 1960s the school started its first Pre-University classes and opened its doors to girls. Through Diligentia, Ingenium and Dexteritas, coupled with visionary leadership and strength of the human spirit, the school rose to be among the top 20 secondary schools by 1986.

The word “Technical” was removed from the school’s name in 1993 and we became known as Tanjong Katong Secondary School (TK). The next leap came in 1998 with the move to our new premises along Haig Road, where students were able to enjoy better amenities and resources.

TK has always focused on providing quality teaching and learning, with emphasis on co-curricular activities, character building and service to the community. The belief in an all-round education ensured TK’s standing as a school of excellence. With its achievement of Autonomous Status in 2004 and the School Excellence Award in 2007, the school continues to provide value-added education, particularly in the academic field, character development and national education.

Our Alumni have distinguished themselves in diverse fields, and to continue to nurture Singapore’s future generations, TK plays its part to prepare a global-ready citizenry which remains rooted and loyal to the nation.
